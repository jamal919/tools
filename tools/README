Description
===========

The SIROCCO tools are a software suite of executables and libraries for pre
and post-processings in ocean modelling (configuration set-up and data/simulations analyses).
It is aimed to accept and be compliant with most Earth science formats.
It is a part of the French national COMODO (community developments for ocean modeling) initiative.

SIROCCO is funded by INSU and Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées/Université Paul Sabatier
and receives project support from CNES, SHOM, IFREMER and ANR.

For more information about SIROCCO, please e-mail sirocco@aero.obs-mip.fr .

The license is GPLv2. Please see the LICENSE file for details.
The SIROCCO tools use external GPL and LGPL scientific codes:
  - GNU Scientific Library
  - triangle package
  - Shapefile C Library
  - and others through the poc-solvers

How to acknowledge
==================

Please acknowledge use of the SIROCCO tools with:
  " The SIROCCO tools are developed and maintained by the SIROCCO national service (CNRS/INSU).
  SIROCCO is funded by INSU and Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées/Université Paul Sabatier
  and receives project support from CNES, SHOM, IFREMER and ANR. "

Dependencies
============

The SIROCCO Tools need:
- optionally the developpment files for shp for Shapefiles (.shp) support
- flex, bison, a late version of the poc-solvers and the developpment files for:
    - proj-4.8 or above (preferably proj-4.9.0b2 or above)
    - gsl, netcdf and lapack
    to compile.

See http://software.opensuse.org/search if you have openSUSE and can not find them on the default repository.

If:
- you do not have administrator priviledges
- and you can not wait for your administrator
  to install the dependencies from your distribution,
user installation instructions for the dependencies are in the DEPENDENCIES_NOT_ROOT.rst file.

How to build
============

Produce configure with :
  > autoreconf -si
and Makefile's with :
  > ./configure
Then compile with :
  > make clean
  > make
You can append make's -j option followed by the number of processors on your machine.
As some versions of autoconf do not deal properly with flex and bison targets,
you may need to use make's -k option and run:
  > make -k
two or three times to compile the first time.

How to update
=============

Once you have modified or updated your sources, update the binaries with:
  > make
If this fails, revert to the full build.

For Doxygen documentation :
  > make doxygen
then READ THE MESSAGE AT THE END!
