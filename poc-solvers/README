Description
===========

The poc-solvers are an interface to many other solvers and are used by the SIROCCO tools and TUGOm.
They are a part of the French national COMODO (community developments for ocean modeling) initiative.

SIROCCO is funded by INSU and Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées/Université Paul Sabatier
and receives project support from CNES, SHOM, IFREMER and ANR.

For more information about SIROCCO, please e-mail sirocco@aero.obs-mip.fr .

The license is GPLv2. Please see the LICENSE file for details.
The poc-solvers use external GPL- or CeCILL-C-licensed scientific codes:
MUMPS, PaStiX, HIPS and SuiteSparse among others.

How to acknowledge
==================

If you use the poc-solvers for your own software, i.e. not through the SIROCCO tools or TUGOm,
please acknowledge use of the poc-solvers with:
  " The poc-solvers are developed and maintained by the SIROCCO national service (CNRS/INSU).
  SIROCCO is funded by INSU and Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées/Université Paul Sabatier
  and receives project support from CNES, SHOM, IFREMER and ANR. "

Dependencies
============

The poc-solvers need:
- bash, wget, ed, automake, g++, gfortran, cmake 2.8 or above
- the development files for lapack and suitesparse
- optionally the development files for scotch, for TUGOm to run faster
- and, if you want to use these with TUGOm, the development files for arpack or parpack
to compile.

If you have openSUSE, you may need to run the following command :
  sudo zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/science/openSUSE_`lsb-release -sr`/science.repo
and also see http://software.opensuse.org/search for other repositories.

If:
- you do not have administrator privileges
- or you can not wait for your administrator
  to install the dependencies from your distribution,
user installation instructions for the dependencies are in the DEPENDENCIES_NOT_ROOT.rst file.

How to build
============

If you have installed some dependencies from source, make sure you have
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH environment variables set properly!

If you have at least suitesparse and scotch in the optional dependencies, run :
  > ./INSTALL.sh
This will compile and install the poc-solvers in this directory. Also,
if you do not have pastix, another dependency, this will do the following beforehand :
- download it in the parent directory. Make sure your proxy is properly configured!
- create a pastix config file in the parent directory, if it does not exist already, and ask you if you are happy with it.
  - if you have several libscotch.so or several scotch.h in /usr, you will have to choose one of them: the simplest is usually the best.
- compile pastix in a parallel directory

If you want to tune the behaviour of this script, run :
  > ./INSTALL.sh -h
to see its documentation.
For example, if the default options fail and you do not want to run TUGOm,
you should run :
  > ./INSTALL.sh -1

If you do not have even suitesparse, make sure you also have
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable set to LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable,
then run :
  > mkdir cmade
  > cd cmade
  > cmake ../src
  > cd ..

How to update
=============

Once you have modified or updated your sources, update the binaries with:
  > make -C cmade install
If this fails, remove the build and install directory with:
  > rm -r cmade
then revert to the full build.
